# Fixtures

Fixtures enable deterministic tests when run_config["network"] == "OFF".

Place:
- courthouse PDF samples in `courthouse_pdfs/`
- saved HTML in `html_snapshots/`
- sample deed/lien/foreclosure PDFs in `docs/`
- partner duplicate lists in `partner_duplicate_lists/`

Keep fixtures small and non-sensitive for GitHub.
For sensitive fixtures, use a private repo or private storage.
